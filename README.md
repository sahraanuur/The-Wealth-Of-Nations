# The-Wealth-Of-Nations

This is my first project exploring and analysing the 'Wealth of Nations' data. The key indicators in this data are GDP, Life Expectancy and Smartphone. 

Data visualisation has become an essential business capability to help transform information into insights that can drive meaningful business outcomes and improved experiences. Today, most organisations have accumulated a wealth of data from the different corners of their businesses; they are then unable to see how this data can help them make better decisions, making actions, and results.

Client Requirements:

The client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries and colour-blind friendly visuals.

The first graph is a world map.The size of each bubble corresponds to the GDP per capita of that country. The larger the bubble, the higher the GDP indicating a higher average economic output. We can see that Monaco has the highest GDP.
One factor for this reason is that Monaco has a high value of tourism, is known for its casinos, and it is a hot place for formula one every year.. Also it has one of the most expensive real estate in the world. 

Life expectancy is  positively correlated to the nation's wealth. Wealthier countries have a higher average life expectancy. We can see Hong Kong ranks number 1 at the age of 85.  One factor for this reason is that  Hong Kong has quality healthcare and social conditions including low infant mortality rate and high youth involvement.

Last graph is showing the average number of smartphone users. The number of smartphone users in a country can also be an indicator of its wealth.  People in advanced economies are more likely to have mobile phones. We can see China ranks first by over 1.5 million smartphone users. India ranks second 
What these two countries have in common is a high population rate and this contributes to its high number of smartphone users. However, do smartphones have a positive correlation to wealth?  Well, smartphone ownership has become accessible in the past couple of years.
