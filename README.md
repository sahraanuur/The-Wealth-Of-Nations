# The-Wealth-Of-Nations

This is my first project exploring and analysing the 'Wealth of Nations' data. The key indicators in this data are GDP, Life Expectancy and Smartphone. 

Data visualisation has become an essential business capability to help transform information into insights that can drive meaningful business outcomes and improved experiences. Today, most organisations have accumulated a wealth of data from the different corners of their businesses; they are then unable to see how this data can help them make better decisions, making actions, and results. You have been asked to look at the data workbook and familiarise yourself with this data. You have also been asked to create a visual report that will show the data in the form of charts and maps using Tableau to the clients requirements. You will also need to consider data protection and computer misuse policies
.
Client Requirements:

The client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. All your visuals should be for the top 20 highest ranking countries.

Topics covered:
Data and Data Structures
Development of Data sets using Excel
Tableau
